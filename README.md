### NOTE
   - Raising an "issue" first would increase the chances of your pull request being noticed.
   - You can raise an issue to ask for .env.local file as it holds the necessary credentials for Firebase.
   - The project requires a ```secret``` file (apart from ```.env.local```) in order to fetch the content from "Cloud Storage" of "Google Cloud Platform". This shall be provided to you if asked for the same.

---

### Scope of Contribution
   - This project particularly seeks improvement in the JSON content inside each file of ```courseFolder```. The JSON forms the basis of module data that is presented inside a particular course üìù.
   - If you are someone who has got a good knowledge of Next JS, you are free to raise an issue and eventually a pull request of your solution/modifications to the code which could enhance the UI of the project üåÑ
   - Even your smallest contribution counts. You will be credited inside both the project as well as in the repository üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.
